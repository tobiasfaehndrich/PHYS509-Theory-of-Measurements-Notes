I am providing you with my raw, unorganized lecture notes, written in LaTeX, for the graduate course UBC PHYS 509 (Theory of Measurements). These notes cover complex topics like probability distributions, Bayesian analysis, error propagation, and parameter estimation. **Your Primary Goal:** To establish a clear, logical structure that follows the academic progression of the topics, while strictly preserving all mathematical and statistical content. **Your Task:** 1. **Structure and Organization (Critical):** * Analyze the content flow to identify distinct topics, definitions, theorems, and derivation steps (e.g., from Probability Interpretation to Parameter Estimation to Hypothesis Testing). * Logically group related concepts and introduce an appropriate **\subsection{Title}** to demarcate each new subtopic. **DO NOT** use **\section{}** or **\subsubsection{}**. * The title for each new subsection must be a concise, academically rigorous description of the content that follows. * **Preserve all existing LaTeX environments** (e.g., \begin{definition}, \begin{theorem}, \begin{proof}, \begin{equation}) and **all mathematical expressions and notation exactly as written** (e.g., do not change $\mathcal{L}$ to $L$, or $\sigma^2$ to $\text{Var}(x)$). 2. **Cleanup and Refinement (Conservative):** * **Fix only obvious typographical errors** in the accompanying plain text (misspelled words, simple grammatical typos). * Correct only minor LaTeX errors (like a clearly missing closing brace } or a typo in a command name, e.g., \boold to \bold) that would prevent proper compilation. 3. **Strict Constraint (Absolutely Essential):** * **DO NOT ADD, DELETE, OR REWORD** any formal mathematical definitions, theorems, lemmas, proofs, or complex derivations. Your role is *formatting*, not *editing the physics/math content*. * **DO NOT** add any introductory or concluding prose, new examples, or explanatory text other than the required subsection titles. **Expected Output:** The complete, cleaned, and structurally organized LaTeX code.
